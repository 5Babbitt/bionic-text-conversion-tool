# bionic-text-conversion-tool
Really simple bionic text conversion tool I made for work. 
It takes input text and converts the first 60% of the word's font to a bold with some special behaviours for outliers. It outputs to HTML and Markdown and is easily open to expansion. 
Great for providing accessibility options for dyslexia and the like. 
The project has example files for demonstration.
